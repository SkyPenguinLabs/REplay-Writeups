# How does this help me in the real world?

One of the main goals of REplay was to make sure people walk away with skills they can use in real world scenarios. Since this playground teaches methodologies and common practice as well as sharpens critical thinking skills, you will not learn much skills directly for real world scenarios more than you will **how** to **look** at real world scenarios.

This was the goal of REplay, to be different, to teach people from a different angle, to teach and educate in a real world scenario.&#x20;

> _For context:_ REplay is a real world game cheat that was pretty much gutted of its original exploit code and bypasses. This game cheat was then deconstructed and stripped of all its protection systems and made to be vulnerable on purpose mimicking **most** of the real world game cheats that exists. Coming from someone who has been cracking, leaking and bypassing game cheats for a few years, it was a step up from the regular CTFs that I have personally experienced outside of privately created CTFs.

**Alas**: It will not give you godly amounts of knowledge, but will instead embed a frame of mind and embed new ideas and angles on approaching different subject matters in the field of reverse engineering such as proprietary file reverse engineering and cryptological reverse engineering.
