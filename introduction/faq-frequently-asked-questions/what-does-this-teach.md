# What does this teach?

The most primary question I got asked when I started this project was - `what will this teach me? Why is it different from other CTFs?`

REplay has one major goal- to teach people `how to build proper and stable methodologies and theory when reverse engineering` whilst also aiming to sharpen a reverse engineers critical thinking skills, logical processing skills and ability to picture different details in a system.&#x20;

This makes it LARGELY different from many other CTFs, as regular CTFs usually focus on one topic of reverse engineering or a problem that is common in binary applications. For example, leaving a administrator or private API key in plaintext on the system, or they focus on primary details of binary auditing one by one until it becomes maxed out as far as what you are auditing.

While these CTFs are good, they are not really teaching people **how** to look at things from different angles. REplay does this not only by incorporating mass dissections, but making sure every detail is as thoroughly explained as possible.&#x20;
