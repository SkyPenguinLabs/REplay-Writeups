# Running The CTF - Know XYZ

In order to run this application (depending on the levels), it will require some form of modification or some form of libraries. Below is the technical information and requirements for the CTF. There are also some things you should know before running the CTF.

> ### System

This CTF was built purely for Windows and compiled for X64 architectures. Please run this in a VM.

> ### Before Running You Should Know ...

Before running this CTF there are a few things to note, they are shown below.

* You may need to run this twice because the software requires files and will create them on startup.
* You will also need to **run this as an administrator in levels 2-3 but in level 1 admin is NOT required**
* Please run this inside of a directory that is stand-alone. This is so that you have your own session environment for which the playground knows where to save files.
* Playground built using **C++20, utilizes ImGui** as a backend and _**D3DX11**_ for the overlay and drawing.
