# Scenario

To make this CTF a proper CTF and more than just a regular CTF, we decided to add a little scenario for you to imagine yourself in. This will also give you a better picture of the way the CTF is structured.

> #### Scenario

In this scenario, you are a reverse engineer who cracks black-hat frameworks (**unethical frameworks such as DDoS panels**) for a living and re-sells them. You come across a game cheat that you want to crack, crack it, and also document specific information about the program including an undocumented button that shuts down the menu. Many users as we have also seen, complained that when pressing the tab exits the menu conflicts with other options- find this virtual key and modify it to become another key. When you are done with both main tasks, go on a hunt to see what else you can find about this cheat.
