# Level 2 - What I Should Have

In order to make sure that you have a proper environment setup to run Level2 of REplay, you must have the following files.

* **SkyOverlay.exe** -> The actual playground name for REplay
* **index.html**           -> A totally super secret HTML file the EXE serves when server accessed

{% hint style="info" %}
For more information on what files are required or downloaded by the program, check out [set-replay-up](../../replay-extras/gui-things/how-to/set-replay-up/ "mention")
{% endhint %}
