# Finished!

If you finished REplay all the way through (including level3  when it comes out) you are most likely a more than intermediate at reversing! But do not stop here- there are a TON of other projects you can do and a lot more to learn!

With that, I present to you this GIF.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cat-space.gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This GIF was chosen as a symbol to express the fact that you are currently floating in space- darkness and you don't know it. Write on it and explore it- build it then break it if you catch what I am saying :D
