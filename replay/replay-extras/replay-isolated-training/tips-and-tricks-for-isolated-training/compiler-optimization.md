# Compiler Optimization

As mentioned in the [where-it-comes-to-use.md](../where-it-comes-to-use.md "mention")part of [..](../ "mention"), compiler optimization is a real pain in the ass, so pay attention to it. Sometimes, it may be best to use pseudo-code generators instead of looking at raw assembly as this will help boil down the optimization an obscene amount!&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Do not become to dependent on pseudo-code generators, as some of them especially depending on the program, architecture, style, and more are bound to have issues and should be used for scenarios where it is an absolute necessity to gain as much high level understanding of the code as possible.
{% endhint %}
