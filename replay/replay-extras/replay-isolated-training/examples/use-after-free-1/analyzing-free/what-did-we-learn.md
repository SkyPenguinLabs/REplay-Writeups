# What did we learn?

To summarize this portion of the examples, we learned how to properly identify specific functions and routines whilst also being able to verify and reverse engineer modified or compiler-tuned functions such as `free` which can be direct pinpoints to vulnerabilities in the program. This should help you grasp a lot of knowledge for the binary auditing portion of this playground in [binary-auditing-6.4.0](../../../../../writeups/level-2-all-walkthroughs/section-6.0-networking-and-web/binary-auditing-6.4.0/ "mention")
