# NO CLICK!

### Help - I can not click on the background!

Well of course. When the menu shows up on the screen, as it does in the screenshot below, your cursor is bound to that overlay and because its an invisible overlay, and that it is static, you are not allowed to move out of that Window.

If you have that main screen, then I suggest using the hotkeys above to solve the issue.
