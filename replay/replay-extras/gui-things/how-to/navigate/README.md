# Navigate

Navigating the menu is a weird and wacky test- the CTF was designed to be that way in hopes to make it more fun for someone wanting to reverse engineer to figure out how the program works from scratch. This was also designed in pages like this one [exit-hotkey-function-verification.md](../../educational/exit-hotkey-function-verification.md "mention")that taught you how to find hotkeys in the program.&#x20;

Anyway, there are many ways to navigate around the GUI, and this section defines some issues you may come across. So, I have defined them into their own little sections that are genuinely specific towards situations I felt would be a pain for users. Especially understanding proper configurations and more.
