# File Generation

{% hint style="warning" %}
Watch where you step here- if you have not finished the CTF, this will give you source code to functions and should not be used as a direct reference for the CTF itsel.
{% endhint %}

In order for REplay to make sure the user experience is as best as possible, REplay checks if files it requires before the GUI can even load are there and if they are not there then REplay will generate them.&#x20;

## The conditions for files (C++20 Src)

The conditional checks get split up into two groups

### <mark style="color:red;">**Conditional Group 1**</mark>

Which is responsible for checking if <mark style="color:red;">client.dll.json</mark> exists and is also responsible for generating the file if the condition is not true.

```cpp
    if (!std::filesystem::exists(currentPath / "client.dll.json")) {
        RuJsonClientDLLJSONFile();
    }
```

Function of `RuJsonClientDLLJSONFile()` is shown on the page linked below.

{% content-ref url="rujsonclientdlljsonfile.md" %}
[rujsonclientdlljsonfile.md](rujsonclientdlljsonfile.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### <mark style="color:red;">**Conditional**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">Group 2</mark>

This group is responsible for checking if the <mark style="color:red;">offsets.json</mark> file exists. If it does not exist within the current directory that the file is being executed in, this file will be generated by calling <mark style="color:red;">RunJsonClientFile</mark>.

```cpp
    if (!std::filesystem::exists(currentPath / "offsets.json")) {
        RunJsonClientFile();
    }
```

Function source code for `RunJsonClientFile` is shown in the page linked below.

{% content-ref url="runjsonclientfile.md" %}
[runjsonclientfile.md](runjsonclientfile.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
