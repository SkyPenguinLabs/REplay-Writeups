# Files

REplay uses many different files internally- especially due to its necessity for storing data for specific payloads and exploits- _e.g:_ offsets and dumper code and even driver signatures. So with that -I thought providing a list of files was helpful for you into their own subcategory.

{% endhint %}

### Required Files&#x20;

This will be re-mentioned in [set-replay-up](../../set-replay-up/ "mention"), but REplay requires that it be in a directory where it has access to files it requires statically. So the following required files are documented here.

<table><thead><tr><th width="205">Filename</th><th>File Type</th><th>Reason for need</th><th>Level Number(s)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>offsets.json</code></td><td>JSON</td><td>Needs it for basic module on mock/simulation payload environment</td><td>L1, L2</td></tr><tr><td><code>client.dll.json</code></td><td>JSON</td><td>Required access for the same as the above file</td><td>L1, L2</td></tr><tr><td><code>index.html</code></td><td>HTML Source File</td><td>Required for the server. But this is shipped with the program only for Level 2 </td><td>L2</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Generated files

There are many files generated by the program over time, both for configuration purposes and for save settings. The following are defined below

| Filename    | File Type           | Reason for need                                                      | Level Number(s) |
| ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `imgui.ini` | Generic Config File | Generated by ImGui library                                           | L1, L2          |
| `nrGJzewj`  | Plain Text          | Required for cryptographic value storage for binary integrity system | L2              |

### Generic Read

Generic read files are files utilized by the GUI system either for fonts or for other IO related matters. The table below showcases these logs in depth. Note that all of these files are for every single level that uses the Windows GUI.

{% hint style="info" %}
COND in the table header represents a specific condition where that file will be used and only used during the condition evaluating to true.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

| File                          | File Type | Reason for use                    | COND                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| C:\Windows\Fonts\verdanab.ttf | Font file | Generic text value                |                                                              |
| C:\Windows\Fonts\verdanai.ttf | Font file | GUI title text, GUI subtitle text |                                                              |
| "C:\Windows\Fonts\Verdana.ttf | Font file | GUI regular text output           |                                                              |
| Orbitron.ttf                  | Font file | GUI regular text output           | Special condition if the file exists or so happens to exist  |
