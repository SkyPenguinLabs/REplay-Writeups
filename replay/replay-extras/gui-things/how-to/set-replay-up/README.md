# Set REplay up

Setting up REplay is not that hard. Its literally just dragging and dropping an EXE file into a reverse engineering framework. However, we do have a suggested setup environment for you that should work.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ideally, it would be smart if you put this on a VM instead of worked on your own machine. This isolates the application, makes a lot less noise, its much more smoother to work in and can be a better experience overall.
{% endhint %}
