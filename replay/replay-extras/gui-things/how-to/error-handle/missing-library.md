# Missing Library

REplay makes use of a few libraries and sometimes, you can get an error saying you are missing that library- especially if you are on an outdated system or do not have the proper graphics libraries installed. For further context on **what** REplay actually uses, I developed a technical session for you shown below

### How to solve missing library issues?

Well, if REplay is giving you a runtime warning saying a library is missing- the best thing to do is to take the name of the library into google followed by "install" which should be enough to give you some results on how to install the library.

### Are they a huge problem

With REplay yes they are. REplay absolutely depends on some libraries like D3D11 to run for its graphical making and libraries- especially core dependancies like the Windows DLLs.
