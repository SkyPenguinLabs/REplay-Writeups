As you see in the above image. This image contains a cryptographic phrase that says

## The World Is Yours

This is a cipher known as Penguin6 or P6 for short. This cipher was developed mainly for paperback or digital communication. The reason it was designed was just to say 'fuck it' before it actually became used and (somewhat) secured in further systems.

The meaning behind this phrase is to say - "the world is yours" and because it is yours, you can draw all over it- its literally an open canvas.

This phrase also goes to say that there is no limitation and that these 'limitations' we place on ourselves are just things we tell ourselves to be lazy and prevent the use of doing something. Obviously, we have logistics that play into what we can or can not do and sometimes those can be limitations- but like life, you can always find a way around it.&#x20;

### Personal Meaning&#x20;

To me this phrase is important because it shows the readers that like - "wow the world is truly filled of opportunity". If you push hard enough, and execute properly- you can do anything you want!
