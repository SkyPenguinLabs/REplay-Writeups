# Rules and Regulations

In order for REplay to be a proper playground where people can learn and have fun, we must define a set of rules that will make sure our community stays in tact and also stays chill when you do take the grounds over!&#x20;

### Your client? Your choice

REplay is purely client side reverse engineering. The concept is to give reverse engineers and aspiring exploit developers as well as community members the chance to work in a client-side, production ready game cheat. None of the results of this application are client side, if they were, then goodluck!

But anyway- I am not a game company. If you want to completely RIP (pun intended :smirk:) REplays organs out feel free too. Find as many flaws as possible even if its out of the bounds of objectives, it helps you train and will help you gain a substantial amount of knowledge!

We simply do not give a fuck what you do to REplay on your own time as far as reverse engineering and exploitation is considered- have at it.

{% hint style="info" %}
This exploitation only counts towards the application itself. Nothing more, nothing less.
{% endhint %}

### Bragging rights&#x20;

Many people who finish a CTF just loveee to brag about how much of a god they were because they finished it. Believe what you want, but this CTF is merely an introduction to real world software reversing despite remaining as real world as possible and is mainly based around personal experience reverse engineering...

* _Game exploits_&#x20;
* _Black hat frameworks (DDoS tools, Zero day automators, and more)_
* &#x20;_Pirating software_
* _and more..._

So as far as bragging rights go- just because you finished the playground does not mean you are a god! The end goal of this playground is to educate people on specific aspects of the reverse engineering world in a real space, not built so people to brag and put others down.

{% hint style="info" %}
Bragging is just normal for people to do, nothing against it- but I picture people being a dick to others once they finish this :joy\_cat: expect the unexpected and trust no person to do the right thing with this LMAO!
{% endhint %}
