# The Goods O\_O

It may surprise you to here that REplay actually LOVES you if you report a vulnerability that was not known to the developer.

### Why the fuck do we do this?

Well because this is REplay and its designed to be vulnerable, having more vulnerabilities means the better and stronger REplay gets to become.&#x20;

Lets say, for some random reason you stumble across a buffer overflow that I personally did not know existed. If you send me a full fledged writeup on how you can exploit this, just simple instructions as to **how** you were able to exploit it, then I have no problem accepting that.

### What will the owner do?

The owner of REplay, me, will probably contact you back by asking you these few questions.

* Are you willing to publicize the vulnerability you found?
* Are you open to me putting it on REplays docs?
* If you were to have your name on REplay, would you?

Why?

### What you get

For telling me a bug, as defined in [..](../../../ "mention"), you most likely won't be paid or anything. But that is because I get nothing out of this at all, this is free, I did this all by myself and spent sooo much time doing the writeups, documenting, reviewing, developing, designing and more that I can just not give too much out.

BUT, if you report a flaw that can contribute to the education of users, or a flaw just in general that can be added- here is what will happen.

#### Custom GitBook Page

If you find a flaw and are open to adding it as a feature to REplay, I would love to write you out your own custom GitBook page for the flaw. Ideally: I would take the flaw, exploit it myself, go through the writeups and make sure this is repeatable, and then would start building a page to document it.

Ideally, this page would be going into the [..](../../../../ "mention")as an extra writeup and objective for people to complete.&#x20;

_<mark style="color:yellow;">**This page contains**</mark>_&#x20;

* Your alias/name basically proper credits&#x20;
* Any socials regarding your tags
* &#x20;and of course supporting other needs.

#### Choices for product

The one thing I have done in the past is give away existing product that I have produced personally. If you also wanted, in addition to the Gitbook page- I will offer you a chance to get the PDF version of either the Game Hackers Field Manual, Black Hat Python Manual, or the [Black Hat Go Manual](https://www.amazon.com/BHGM-Black-Hat-Go-Manual-ebook/dp/B0CBNTKP6R/ref=sr\_1\_1?crid=BHYRVJ7IU8ZW\&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ykjGoIcCO0XS9ZbyaA7OZKR1vmznLs9\_ujYn0UdMJdHGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.VaaJlr5WkZ8EyE0mDqsvpVSwFPbqJSDb1FHXAYD5Yt4\&dib\_tag=se\&keywords=black+hat+go+manual\&qid=1711749194\&s=digital-text\&sprefix=%2Cdigital-text%2C227\&sr=1-1)!
