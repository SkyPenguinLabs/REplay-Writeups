# What Happens If I Report?

If you report, we want to make sure that your report is actually thanked and welcome, so I wanted to mention two separate branches of reports you can make to the developer ( [who-maintains-it.md](../../../../../introduction/faq-frequently-asked-questions/who-maintains-it.md "mention")).

> For vulnerabilities

If you explore or find a vulnerability inside of REplay, check out&#x20;

{% content-ref url="vulnerabilities/" %}
[vulnerabilities](vulnerabilities/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

> For bugs / issues in UX and UI

{% content-ref url="common-issues.md" %}
[common-issues.md](common-issues.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
