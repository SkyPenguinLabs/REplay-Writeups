# CTF Design

REplay is constantly undergoing changes and I am always willing to accept new ideas if the idea could be implement. Please keep in mind that this is a one person thing, so if you propose an idea, make sure it is reasonable for one alien like human pls!

> Scope of design&#x20;

The scope of REplay is to be specific to reverse engineering as an entire feild. However, this does not mean the scope is limited- because its not. You can include aspects of:

* Protocol reversing
* File reversing (reversing proprietary files)
* Authentication / Security reversing&#x20;
* Security bypassing (RE to full bypass)
* APK reverse engineering
* Windows C/C++ reversing
* API reversing
* Cryptological reversing (anything to do with keys, authentication, protocols, etc)
* PE Analysis
* ELF Analysis

and so much more. As long as it stands within the realm of reverse engineering and analysis then we are good.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that other CTFs are also accepted. Since REplay combines fields like web and merges them together, you can also include web security or since REplay L3 will implement network protocols you can include NetSec.\
\
But note that the suggestion has to include some form of reversing element to it. This can include analysis or RE of obfuscated JS and other source files.\
\
Stop trying and be creative (creativity is not always trying so hard to impress)! Let that brain go!
