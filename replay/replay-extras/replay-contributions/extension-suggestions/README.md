# Extension Suggestions

Another huge thing is suggesting an extension of a particular part of the playground. For example, lets say you played the networking and web section,  then did the sub-section [binary-auditing-6.4.0](../../../writeups/level-2-all-walkthroughs/section-6.0-networking-and-web/binary-auditing-6.4.0/ "mention") and thought that the binary auditing portion of the CTF could be extended. Please let me know!

Simply fill out the simple questions below.

| Question                                                     | What it means                                      | What I need                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <mark style="color:red;">Why should this be included?</mark> | Why are we extending the section? Is it worth it?  | I need you to explain to me why this needs to be included into REplay- why you think its cool and what you feel it can do for REplay                                                                                              |
| <mark style="color:red;">What will this require?</mark>      | What will need to be added to the section?         | I need you to explain what this feature or extension will both require and involve.                                                                                                                                               |
| <mark style="color:red;">Am I within realms?</mark>          | Does this extension cross any platform boundaries? | If you want to suggest an extension of a existing section, then I need you to tell me if this is outside (_x86/x64 Windows10_). If it is, then check [scenario-systemic-extensions.md](scenario-systemic-extensions.md "mention") |
