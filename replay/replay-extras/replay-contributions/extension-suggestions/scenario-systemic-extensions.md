# Scenario / Systemic Extensions

I picture that some people may think that there should be a Linux version of this. So, if you are down for that, definitely pitch and throw some ideas at me as I will accept them in later versions. For now- the goal of this was to be a CTF written in C++ for Linux.&#x20;

Below is the base for REplay-Linux

* Architecture - x86/x64
* Languages   - C++/Go
* Subject          - Reverse Engineering
* Mode              - Usermode (UM)
* Third party?  - Yes/No ( depends on the level design )
* &#x20;         &#x20;
