# Resources - Educators

There are many people in the reverse engineering community that have provided in depth lessons for reverse engineering, malware analysis, software cracking, software modification and more that are bound to help you thrive! Here are my personal top picks

* **1: Kevin Thomas** (_mytechnotalent_): Kevin is a proficient software reverse engineer and engineer with a serious KILLER course on reverse engineering done with 0xInfection. This course is an entire base breakdown of multiple architectures including X86, Arm32, and X32 all of which can help you understand how to reverse engineer, analyze, pick apart, modify and search for Data types, data structures, logic gates and more! Check this course out here -[ Reversing Course](https://0xinfection.github.io/reversing/).
* **2: Live Overflow:** A common one and a well known educator but [LiveOverflow ](https://www.youtube.com/@LiveOverflow)is definitely good for understanding how to reverse engineer many complex and real world scenarios such as compression algorithms.&#x20;
* **3**: **Fopwn from Martian Defense**: Fopwn has done minimal but quality and really helpful workshops on reverse engineering and analyzing malware! Not only does this give people fundamental experience with real world scenarios and threats. Some of their training includes reverse engineering [Crosslock](https://youtube.com/watch?v=IG2FkCHMNKU), and reverse engineering [NotPetYa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnslBzi8Jwo)! Both of these videos by the way are linked because I felt that they were definitely good resources.&#x20;
