# Resources - Books

Books are something that I have always been a fan of doing with reverse engineering- specifically when I was getting started, they became a massive help and also gave me a break from the screen haha! So here are some of the books that helped me thrive in reverse engineering!

* **Practical Binary Analysis:** While this book was not ALL reverse engineering, it helped me deeply grasp so many concepts revolving around different executable formats like PE (Portable Executable) and ELF files while also analyzing scenarios and finding ways to build my own tools to automate these processes and scenarios! Huge recommendation to read.
* **Secrets Of Reverse Engineering:** This book is most definitely old- its one of those books that despite being old actually still packs a punch to reverse engineers that want to get started in a newer area. This book is most definitely worth the read and introduces you to keygenning, cracking, reverse engineering APIs and more in proprietary systems.
* **Attacking Network Protocols:** This book was helpful to understand how to reverse engineer specific programs, disassemble programs and also dissect network protocols for a deeper in breadth understanding of the protocols. Definitely worth it if you find yourself reverse engineering proprietary network protocols.
* **Practical Malware Analysis:** A book I DEFNITELY need to finish but is worth the read for people who want to deep dive into analyzing malware and other malicious software whilst also being able to pick up core methodologies and theories.
* **Rootkits and Bootkits:** This book has already been extremely helpful to learning not only mistakes common malware developers make but also understanding how bootkits and rootkits work whilst also providing you with a quick and easy way to understand fundamentals . It is suggested though you understand some basics going into the book- as it may be hard for readers to comprehend who are new to malware analysis.&#x20;
* **Game Hacking (Developing Autonomous Bots for Online Games):** This book was really based on theory around for game hacking but gave you a seriously good foundation on how hooking works, dll injection, and various other techniques used by game cheaters to evade/circumvent both EDRs and AC (AntiCheat) systems like EAC, BE, and others.
