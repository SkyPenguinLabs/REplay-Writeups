# Resources - Communities

With the world of reverse engineering comes many difficult times- there are times you will want to slam your face into a wall and times where the reverse engineering world becomes heavier- sometimes the walls talk. But either way, one way to help stimulate this (because most reverse engineers are mentally insane as we thrive in insanity) you can always go to communities! Here are some of my top pics for communities in the reverse engineering world.

* **Martian Defense:** While not particularly reverse engineering, Martian Defense has an amazing group of reverse engineers such as the great raccoonified Fopwn who exist to do talks and presentations! All in all, a great community also developed and created by someone with a brain and a deep thrive to change the industry from within- even if that means occasionally slapping people in the face when they LARP LMAO!
* **VX Underground Community**: This community is one community filled of malware developers, reverse engineers, exploit developers, threat hunters and your neighborhood glowee/fed whos there to simply watch and stalk you as you drop and leak new zero days LOL! No, all in all- VX Underground is a community flooded with so much talent.
* **DefCon Communities:** There are many defcon groups all of which depending on who they are can have a good amount of reverse engineers or hardware hackers in them. I have found many communities such as DC407, DC813, and most notable DC540 to have some good reverse engineer

All communities cybersecurity in general or reverse engineering specific are going to help you meet and talk with people who have a very similar skillset or a much more advanced level of knowledge. I have met ssoooo many proficient reverse engineers and entire groups that can topple the most complex applications in as much as a few days! Its insane the type of people you can meet and definitely worth going over.&#x20;
