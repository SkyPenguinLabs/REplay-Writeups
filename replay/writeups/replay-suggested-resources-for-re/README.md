# REplay - Suggested Resources For RE

REplay was a CTF designed to help people get a jump start into the reverse engineering world! However, REplay still requires (even for the first level) some form of prior experience in C++, Windows application reverse engineering or at least fundamental knowledge in reverse engineering in general. That is if you are going through REplay without writeups. So, this section is dedicated to resources on reverse engineering based on sub-topics that can help you learn and maneuver around in this field.
