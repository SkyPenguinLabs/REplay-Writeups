# Why Are We Using Different Languages?

You may have noticed that within REplay's writeups exist many different tools written in many different languages. The main tools we use are written using Python, Go, C++, and PowerShell! But why the switch? Is this not confusing?

### The reality of this

Coming from my background in reverse engineering- it does not really matter what language you do something in UNLESS its MASSIVE and it needs to be really performant in which the language and the way the code is designed matters. But of course, this is a very very rare off chance that this actually needs to be a concern.

The reason I chose to use multiple programming languages was mainly due to the following two points below.

* **Fun**: I have a really large vast set of experience in different languages and find it fun to challenge myself to see if I have skill still in these languages and see what I can do and how far I can go- also learning and growing as I achieve this. Since REplay was a personal project, the documentation also became a bit personal.
* **More Promotion**: In the community, many people have told me I NEED to use Python for exploit development or NEED to use Rust for game hacking and all this and that. It got really annoying- so I wanted to show people that as long as the program gets the job done, it does not matter and promoting this is a pretty good thing (so I feel personally).&#x20;

So mainly, you can say it is all personal which is not a huge problem- in fact, these scripts are not meant for you to just copy and paste and use everywhere. They instead are just there to look at logic and walk through the CTF with me and the way I was picturing things at the time.&#x20;
