# Objectives you need to complete



**`In order to move onto this level, Level 2 or Part 2 of the CTF, you need to be able to crack the first login system in Level 1 and gain access to other tabs using methods similar to`** [crippling-logins.md](../level-1-all-walkthroughs/bypass-entirely-login-system/crippling-logins.md "mention").&#x20;



Also make sure you can properly go through [locating-the-binary-integrity-system](section-1.0-binary-integrity-system/locating-the-binary-integrity-system/ "mention")and then swapping back to [locating-the-thread-management-calls.md](locating-the-thread-management-calls.md "mention"). This will help you breeze through this section.
