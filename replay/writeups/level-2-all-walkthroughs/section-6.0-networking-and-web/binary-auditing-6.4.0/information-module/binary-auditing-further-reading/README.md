# Binary Auditing - Further Reading

Reverse engineering and auditing binary applications is not an easy task- because of how intricate it can be, we must understand **how** to find the vulnerabilities, **where** to start auditing binaries, **where** to look, **what** to do after, and so on from there.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that binary auditing is a very niche field- it is suggested that when you enter this field you will need to expect that resources are not very largely out there and a lot of the training will come from your own understanding of memory, dynamic and static analysis, and vulnerabilities in compiled applications.
{% endhint %}
