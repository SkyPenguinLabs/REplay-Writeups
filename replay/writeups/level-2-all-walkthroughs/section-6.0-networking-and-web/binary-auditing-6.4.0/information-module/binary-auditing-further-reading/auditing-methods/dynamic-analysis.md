# Dynamic Analysis

I should not be the first nor the last person to tell you that dynamic analysis SERIOUSLY helps massively here. If you can manage to bypass a programs protection mechanisms (such as anti-debug and anti-analysis techniques) then you can easily find a way to attach a debugger and debug in the location of where said fault or crash happened.

Since we are not going to be using dynamic analysis on REplay for these writeups, I want to formally assert that despite not being used here, dynamic analysis in the real world is extremely helpful and one of the more stronger actions to take especially when analyzing binaries like this.
