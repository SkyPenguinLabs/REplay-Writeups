This is a section that is still in development as binary exploitation is a very niche field that I personally have not mastered. This is why I kept the section light, despite my experience writing exploits for applications- I have not fully grasped the fundamental core of binary exploitation. So excuse the minimal examples but I do suggest you follow the links put into this.
