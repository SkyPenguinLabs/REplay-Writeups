# Binary Auditing - 6.4.0

### What is this task?

This task is actually a primary task with multiple routines in it. Ideally, your goal for this is to audit the server routine. Go through its code and find something that is vulnerable. This is a multitude of problems and security vulnerabilities. Find them out and for fun, maybe create a unique little binary auditing report!
