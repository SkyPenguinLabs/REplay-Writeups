# Static Key Generation

### What is this task?

This task is asking us to analyze a system that generates keys. This was the system used within the server to check ADMIN-IDs. By being able to view the seed or value used for the key generation sequence, and being able to prove this is for the key generator, you can build your own generation system to either generate the key or one that can guess the key. Really, just analyze the key generation system and figure out how the sequence works.
