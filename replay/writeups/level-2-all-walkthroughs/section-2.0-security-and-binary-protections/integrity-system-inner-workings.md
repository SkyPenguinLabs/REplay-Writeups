# Integrity System Inner Workings

### What is this task?

This task wants us to explain how the integrity system worked. For this scenario, I provided a logical map along the answer but you do not need to do this. This task can be solved by explaining or graphically demonstrating the logic and control flow of the binary integrity system- how its triggered and how it ends based on specific conditions and what fallbacks it has or prechecks it has before running the system and comparison of the production hash and the current binary hash.
