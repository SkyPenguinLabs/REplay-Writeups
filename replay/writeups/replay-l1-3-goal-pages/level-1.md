# Level 1

In order to finish level 1 of REplay, basically just you need to find all the data and finish all off the questions and objectives. You also need to fully bypass the login system in order to solve the objectives in Level 2. Since this is an introduction to REplay, the objectives were just kept minimum and the end goal was to make sure you grasped the fundamentals and the concepts taught throughout some of the writeups.
