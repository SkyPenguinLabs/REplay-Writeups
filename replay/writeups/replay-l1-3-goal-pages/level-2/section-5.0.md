# Section 5.0

### What was the end goal?

The end goal of this section was to find multiple vulnerabilities that can be abused later down the line in the binary. This gives you more real world practice for hunting down flaws complex or basic in applications.

### What was I supposed to learn?

You were supposed to pick up different techniques and ideas on how to spot vulnerabilities or flaws in binary applications via reverse engineering statically.&#x20;
