# Section 4.0

### What was the end goal?

Section 4.0 in L2 was a little bit weird- the methodologies and theories we use to find specific functions in a program were a bit different. However, the end goal was to make sure you knew how to modify specific applications, be able to understand how functions can be traced and so on from there.&#x20;

### What was I supposed to learn?

You were supposed to pick up some form of logical comprehension skills that allow you to look at an application from all different types of angles and also find new ways to make an application do things it was not initially meant or designed to do!
