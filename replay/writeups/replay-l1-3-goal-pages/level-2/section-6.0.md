# Section 6.0

### What was the end goal?

The end goal for this section was to get XSS on the web server, find and locate the web server, analyze its internals and also discovery flaws in the data handling process for this server on the binaries side. &#x20;

### What was I supposed to learn?

You were mainly supposed to understand that binary reverse engineering is not always going to be about just the binary- in fact, it can be an entire sleuth of things! With that, you should have also picked up techniques on how to spot local servers and how to analyze different systems outside of the binary itself.&#x20;
