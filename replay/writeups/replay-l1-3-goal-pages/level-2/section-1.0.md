# Section 1.0

### What is the end goal?

The end goal of this should be that you can effectively bypass the binary integrity systems allowing you to actively make changes to the application and also have documented and explored how the binary integrity system worked.

### What was I supposed to learn?

You were supposed to understand how binary integrity systems work and also understand the differences between server side and client side integrity checks by being able to pinpoint the flaws in local binary integrity systems.
