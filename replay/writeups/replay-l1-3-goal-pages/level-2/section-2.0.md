# Section 2.0

### What is the end goal?

The end goal of this section is defined as being able to understand and fully reverse engineer all the protection mechanisms used in Level 2. This includes anything from anti-debug to anti-analysis systems that may be included!

### What was I supposed to learn?

You should have learned how to analyze both obvious and hidden integrity systems and protection mechanisms put on client side applications! This should have also given you an idea of what security systems are common to exist within proprietary applications and that some systems are bound to be hidden.
