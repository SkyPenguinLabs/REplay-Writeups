# Section 3.0

### What is the end goal?

The end goal of this section was to get you to do a tiny bit of OSINT as a side-quest/break. Ideally, all you had to do was just find the user account that posted the production hash on pastebin.

### What was I supposed to learn?

Nothing too much, just that it may be worth it especially in environments like this to go through user accounts as they could be tied to higher more powerful accounts or platforms and may also lead you down a hunting rabbit hole worth exploring.
