# L-0 - What Defines Finished?

Since REplay is not designed to have auto correction and auto system mechanisms to detect when and how you finished a level, it may be hard for users to define when they have finished the playground and to this end- the question remains, "what defines finished?"

### Defining Finished

Finished with this playground means you have finished a specific level meaning you have not only completed all objectives but can also answer all questions exactly without any writeups. Since there is no winning or loosing, I want to make people know that real world reverse engineering is not always about finding a vulnerability. It can be for...

* interoperability
* Exploit development
* Plugin development (another way of saying interoperability really)
* Experimental/fun
* Modification
* Finding and locating undocumented features

and so much more outside of that list. This is why we do not really have a placement of people, a digital leaderboard or submission and so on from there. This playground is really just for fun and can be used to boost your education in many different fields of computer science and cybersecurity research with a focus on low level research.
