# Bypass entirely - login system

### What is this?

Crack the login system? But did we not already do that on this page? [crack-the-first-login-system.md](../crack-the-first-login-system.md "mention")

I am here to tell you that you did not crack the login system! This is exactly the purpose of it. The login system that you `cracked` was not a login system at all. It was just some boolean function that checks the status of a global variable in the program and renders text onto the GUI!

### Why did I do this?

I did this to represent that in real-world scenarios, cracking login systems _(even in-game cheats)_ is not the easiest thing to do- and most of the time, you will find yourself in a rabbit hole.

This is because more advanced cheats are going to be using some universally accessible or globally accessible system, using complex thread managers, and more- this is for high-quality cheats as well. Some even lock their entire process down to only kernel-mode applications!

**This is also to give the user more exposure to real-world circumstances, despite this first level being relatively easy to finish**&#x20;

### Completing This Task

For this task, I created a subpage called `Crippling Logins` which will walk you through the process of digging through the code for this login function.

> **Note:** Ideally, you would try to dig through this first before going through the walkthrough, but if you need help, you can look at the **internal design**  on the next page as well for helpful insights as to how this is structured on the code side.

_**To complete this task**_, you must be able to click on other tabs in the menu and navigate through each tab without any authentication issues or warnings or pop up blocks.
