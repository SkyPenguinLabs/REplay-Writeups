# Find the hotkey that is used to exit the menu and kill the current process

### What is this?

This task is pretty much asking you to find another undocumented feature. This undocumented feature or system is the button that allows you to exit the program entirely. It is a hotkey.

This is another one I want to let the person do on their own but I still will provide the answer too for checking.&#x20;

> **Tip:** You can use the same process from the page below

{% content-ref url="modify-the-variable-of-the-hide-menu-functionality.md" %}
[modify-the-variable-of-the-hide-menu-functionality.md](modify-the-variable-of-the-hide-menu-functionality.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Answer

The answer to this is the `Tab` key. This as a virtual key code is `VK_TAB` which maps to `0x09`

### Extra Verification

Your first question, if you never got the answer is `How did I know that this was a exit function?` well, check out [exit-hotkey-function-verification.md](../../replay-extras/gui-things/exit-hotkey-function-verification.md "mention")on how to verify the functions
